1. To get a list of known shells in the system:
        /etc/shells file
2. My default shell is stored in the :
        /etc/passwd file : "root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash"
        
        How to read passwd file:
        
        
    root: Account username.
    a) x: Placeholder for password information. The password is obtained from the "/etc/shadow" file.
    b) 0: User ID. Each user has a unique ID that identifies them on the system. The root user is always referenced by user ID 0.
    c) 0: Group ID. Each group has a unique group ID. Each user has a "primary" group that is used as the group by default. 
          Again, the root group's ID is always 0.
    d) root: Comment field. This field can be used to describe the user or user's function. This can be anything from 
        contact information for the user, to descriptions of the service the account was made for.
    e) /root: Home directory. For regular users, this would usually be "/home/username". For root, this is "/root".
    f) /bin/bash: User shell. This field contains the shell that will be spawned or the command that will be 
        run when the user logs in.
        As you add user accounts using commands like "adduser" and "useradd", or as you install more services, 
        this file will grow. New username information will be added to the bottom of this file.

3. etc/shadow : This shows user password information
            How to read shadow file:
      These are fields defined in the "/etc/shadow" file:

    daemon: Account username.
    a)*: Salt and hashed password. You can see what this looks like with the root entry above. 
      As noted above, the asterisk signifies that this account cannot be used to log in.
    b)15455: Last password change. This value is measured in days from the Unix "epoch", which is January 1, 1970.
    c)0: Days until password change permitted. 0 in this field means there are no restrictions.
    d)99999: Days until password change required. 99999 means that there is no limit to how long the current password is valid.
    e)7: Days of warning prior to expiration. If there is a password change requirement, this will warn the user to change their
        password this many days in advance.
    f)[blank]The last three fields are used to denote days before the account is made inactive, days since the Epoch when the 
        account expires. The last field is unused.

4. Linux treats everything as a file, even hardware or peripheral devices. "/dev/"
5. "/etc/" - system related configuration files
6. "/bin" - executables and commands
7. "/opt" - software packages or programs are installed
8. "/var" - log files and printer spools
9. GRUB
        a) Grub config file: /boot/grub/grub.conf
        b) First process is loaded from "init"
        c) Services are started by "init"
        d) UPstart : theconfig files for upstart is at : etc/init : It is a series of bootup scripts

10. System Initialization run-levels
        a) 0 - shutdown
        b) 1 - Single user mode
        c) 2 - Multiuser without n/w and GUI
        d) 3 - Multiuser with n/w and without GUI
        e) 4 - Not used
        f) 5 - Graphical multiuser with N/W
        g) 6 - Restarting
11. How to check current Runlevels:
        a) runlevel
        b) "n" is the previous runlevel and "5" is the cureent runlevel
        c) Change the current runlevel: "init 3": Changes the current runlevel to 3
        d) To permanently change the runlevel: "etc/inittab" file
