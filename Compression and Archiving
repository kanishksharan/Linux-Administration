1. .tar is used to archive many files into one (no compression)
2. .gz (gzip) is used to compress and decompress files

All the detailed theory is mentioned in my notes, refer to it.

1. tar cf /root/Desktop/archive_1.tar  /root/lab/{awkey,hozier,hozier_tmp} : create, file
2. tar tf /root/Desktop/archive_1.tar : list = t, f = file: 
3. tar xf /root/Desktop/archive_1.tar : x = extract, f = file :file will be unarchived at the pwd
4. tar tfv /root/Desktop/archive_1.tar : v = verbose

 Note : gzip/bzip work on single files only and not multiple files

1. gzip /root/Desktop/archive_1
2. tar czf /root/Desktop/zipped.gz {awkey,hozier,hozier_tmp} : z = compress: archived and compressed
