How to hack into the root account by changing the passwd:
1. When the times screen appears (5,4,3,2,1) then press "e"
2. Then on the kernel menu (usually the second menu option) press "e"
3. Once inside the kernel menu type "single" enter and then come out of there by pressing escape.
4. Now once again on the kernel screen hit "b" for boot
5. Once on the terminal "passwd"
6. Enter password and you have successfully changed the password for the "root" account.

2. How to protect yourself from being hacked in the above way:
  1) edit the file /etc/inittab
  2) Just above the "initdefault" line, enter this line of code:
      "su:S:wait:/sbin/sulogin", save and then exit
3. Shutdown command
    1) shutdown -h +10 : shutdown halt for 10 minutes
    2) shutdown -r : restart
    3) shutdown -c : cancel shutdown command
4. Rebbot command:
    1) reboot -p : shutdown
    2) reboot -f : forcibly
5. RPM Packages:
    1) rpm format: Packagename.version.release.architect.rpm
    2) It provides package management:
        1) Instaal
        2) Remove/Uninstall
        3) Upgrade
        4) Query
        5) Verify
6. Updating a kernel RPM:
    1) Check the kernel version: "uname -a"
        <OS> <Fully Qualified domain Name (FQDN)> <(2.6) refers to the major version,(.32) refers to the minor version,if 
        the minor version is an odd number 
        then it's a Beta version, anything after the minor version number indcates that the kernel has been patched 
        by the distributor> <Date and time, the kernel was compiled>
    2) Reveal installed versions: 'rpm -qa | grep -i kernel'
    3) Check the kernel version with 'gedit /etc/grub.conf'. The same file is also located at /boot/grub/grub.conf
    4) Install the new version: 'rpm -ivh kernel-2.6.18-398.el5.i686.rpm
    5) Once installed the '/etc/grub/grub.conf' will be updated with the new version.
    6) 'rpm -qa' Queries all the all the installed rpms
    7) 'rpm -qa |wc -l' count the total number of installed packages
    8) 'rpm -qa | grep -i ftp' returns all the installed packages containing 'ftp'
    9) 'rpm -qi firefox' : gives the details of the packages firefox. 'qi means query info'
    10) 'rpm -qf /usr/bin/ftp' : Gives which rpm package is given file associated with. 'qf = query file'
    11) 'rpm -ql ftp' : Gives all the related files for that package (ftp)
    12) 'rpm -Va':Verifies all documents, returning info only if there are discrepancies from the original installation.
    13) 'rpm -Va /usr/bin/vsftpd': This command displays only those files that have been modified since installation. Check slide #
          56.
    14) 'rpm -ivh <package>' : install, verbose, human
    15) 'rpm -Uvh <package>' : Update, verbose, human
    16) 'rpm -Fvh *.rpm': Update all the installed rpms
