GREP : Globally search a Regular Expression and Print

General Syntax: grep "literal string" <filename>
1. Searching for a string in a single file:
    a) grep "version 2" /root/hozier
2. Searching for the string in multiple files
    b) grep "version 2" /root/hozier*
3. Case insensitive Search (by default grep is case sensitive)
    c) grep -i "This" /root/hozier*
4. Using it with regulr expressions
    d) grep '"*' /root/hozier : starting from " (double quotes) and anything as indicated by "*" asterisk
5. Search for the exact word
    e) grep -iw "word" /root/hozier
6. Retrive n number of lines after a match
    f) grep -A 3 -i "word" /root/hozier
7. Retrieve n number of lines before a match
    g) grep -B 3 -i "word" /root/hozier
8) Rerieve n number of lines around a match
    h) grep -C 3 -i "word" /root/hozier
9) Search recursively
    i) grep -r "word"* : this will search for the word "word" in recursive dirs, within the pwd, as well
10) Count the number of occurrence
    j) grep -c "word" * : this will search in the current directory only
    k) grep -rc "word" *: same as above but in recursive dirs as well
11) Count the number of non-occurrences
    l) grep -v "word"* : in the current directory
12) Display on those files that match the given pattern
    m) grep -I "regular expression"*
